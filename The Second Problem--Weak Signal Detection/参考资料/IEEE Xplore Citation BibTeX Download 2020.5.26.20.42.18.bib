  abstract={First, 8 Gbps Is needed, at a minimum, to develop Earth-Mars communication in the era of a Mars human community and to create a mirror database of Earth's Internet search engine on Mars. Second, a 10 Gbps Earth-Mars link Is shown to be feasible, assuming 1.2 m diameter optical antennas, a receiver of 0.3 photons/bit sensitivity in the 1.55 Î¼m wavelength band, Pulse Position Modulation/Frequency Shift Keying, and cluster satellites. Finally, the Internet protocol of such a disruption tolerant network is described.},
